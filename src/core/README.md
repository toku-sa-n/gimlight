# Gimlight Core Package

This is the core package for Gimlight written in Coq. It contains platform-independent definitions and theorems for the logic of the game.

[Due to the bug in Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issue/10679), all the source files are in the root directory, and they have snake case names with capitalized first word.
